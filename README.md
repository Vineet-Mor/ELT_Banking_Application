# ELT_Banking_Application
To design and implement an ELT pipeline that extracts financial data from multiple sources, loads it into Google BigQuery, and transforms it within BigQuery for further analysis and reporting. The pipeline will utilize Google Cloud Dataflow for scalable and efficient data processing.

Key Components:
1. Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
2. Google Cloud Dataflow
3. Google BigQuery
4. Cloud Pub/Sub
5. Cloud Scheduler
6. Cloud IAM for security and permissions

Workflow Steps:
1. Project Initiation:<BR>
  -Define Objectives: Automate the ELT process to ensure timely and accurate data loading and transformation in BigQuery.<BR>
  -Identify Stakeholders: Data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, project managers, and financial analysts.<BR>
  
2. Set Up Google Cloud Environment:<BR>
  -Create a Google Cloud Project: Set up a new project in Google Cloud.<BR>
  -APIs: Enable Cloud Storage, Dataflow, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Scheduler APIs.<BR>
  -IAM Roles: Define and assign roles for different team members to ensure proper access control.<BR>

3. Data Extraction:<BR>
  -Trigger: Detect new data in financial data sources (e.g., databases, APIs, files).<BR>
  -Action: Extract data and upload it to a GCS bucket.<BR>
  -Tools: Use Cloud Functions or on-premise scripts to automate data extraction.<BR>

4. Data Loading:<BR>
  -Trigger: New file uploaded to GCS.<BR>
  -Action: Load the raw data into a staging table in BigQuery.<BR>
  -Dataflow Job: Use Dataflow to load data from GCS to BigQuery.<BR>

5. Data Transformation:<BR>
  -Trigger: Data is loaded into the staging table in BigQuery.<BR>
  -Action: Transform the data using Dataproc for complex processing and load the transformed data back into BigQuery.<BR>
  -Dataproc Job: Use Dataproc for processing large datasets and applying complex transformations (example: Add a New Column 'transaction_category',  Filter Out 'Withdrawal' Transactions,Aggregate Data by 'customer_id').<BR>
  -BigQuery Transformations: Use SQL queries to clean, aggregate, and prepare the data for analysis.<BR>

6. Data Governance and Security:<BR>
  -IAM Policies: Control access to GCS, Dataflow, Dataproc and BigQuery.<BR>
  -Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.<BR>
  -Logging and Monitoring: Use Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for visibility and alerting.<BR>

7. Monitoring and Error Handling:<BR>
  -Monitor Dataflow Jobs and Dataproc jobs: Use Cloud Monitoring to track job performance and detect errors.<BR>
  -Cloud Function for Error Handling: Set up a Cloud Function to handle errors and retries.<BR>

8. Scheduling and Automation:<BR>
  -Cloud Scheduler: Automate the initiation of the data extraction process at specified intervals.<BR>
  -Setup Cloud Scheduler: Configure it to trigger the data extraction script or Cloud Function.<BR>

9. Documentation and Metadata Management:<BR>
  -Document ELT Workflows: Include data schemas, transformation logic, and error handling processes.<BR>
  -Use Cloud Data Catalog: Manage metadata and enable data discovery.<BR>

10. Performance Optimization:<BR>
  -Optimize Dataflow and Dataproc Jobs: Ensure jobs are performant and scalable.<BR>
  -Optimize BigQuery: Use partitioning and clustering for efficient querying.<BR>
